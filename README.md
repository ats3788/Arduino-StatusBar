# Arduino-StatusBar
A simble StatusBar for Arduinos and the ILI9341 Display.
This is written for the GC-ESP-WROVER-KIT
but it is easy to chance it to all differnet Arduino Boards
but is using the beautiful  "Adafruit_GFX.h" Library.

Thank you for all the Helpful people out their.

A special thanks to Neil Kolban for writing a ESP8266 and ESP32 book.
